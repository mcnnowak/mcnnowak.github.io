## Who is Michael Nowak?
Hi! I'm Michael Nowak, and I decided that it's probably time for me to build and deploy a personal website.

## Tools used
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Next.js is the nicest front end framework I've used.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a web developer platform that multiplies productivity. This is how my personal site is hosted, how the certs are handled, etc..

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. I use it to manage the posts on my blog.
